Setup Instructions:
Download the game from https://github.com/CaymamCruncher/ArcadeGame and open index.html
to begin the game. This game may not support older browsers such as internet explorer
or safari. Consider changing your browser to firefox or google chrome if the game
won't run for you.

How to play:
You use the arrow keys to move up, right, left, and down. Your goal is to reach
the water without getting hit by a bug. If you touch a bug you will be teleported
back to the beginning position and lose any progress you made. Upon winning the
game one more enemy will be added until there are up to six enemies on the screen.
Now every time you are hit you will lose one enemy as well until the difficulty
goes back to normal.
